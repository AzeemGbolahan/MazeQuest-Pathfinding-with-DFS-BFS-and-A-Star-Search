# MazeQuest-Pathfinding-with-DFS-BFS-and-A-Star-Search
This project implements multiple search algorithms to solve mazes, including Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A*. Built in Java, the program visualizes how different algorithms explore the maze, compare efficiency, and analyze solution quality.
